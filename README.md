##Introduction
As per module project specifications, i have created a 2D Game using HTML5, JavaScript & CSS which i've implemented using 
the HTML5 canvas as a placeholder. The object of the game is to dodge asteroids as they hurtle towards
the User controlled spaceship from the top of the screen. 

##Design
To being with i used a combination of Brackets and notepad++ for my development environment with google chrome and Firefox
as chosen testing web browsers. I have also opted for a logical file split to adhere to the Model View Controller design pattern

The game uses ```window.requestAnimationFrame``` to control the animation flow, this works smoothly and compliments 
the 'left' / 'right' event handlers allowing the user to move in said directions. Collisions have been dealt with 
using an algorithm
